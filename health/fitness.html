                <h4>Mixed Martial Arts</h4>
                <p>Martial arts can be divided into the armed and unarmed arts. The former include archery, spearmanship, and swordsmanship; the latter, which originated in China, emphasize striking with the feet and hands or grappling. In Japan, traditionally a warrior’s training emphasized archery, swordsmanship, unarmed combat, and swimming in armour.</p>

                <h4>Boxing</h4>
                <p>Boxing is a combat sport that has been practiced since before the time of ancient Greece and the original Olympics. It has been used to train people for performance in the art of striking, as well as general physical conditioning.

                  Recently, it has become more popular as a form of exercise. When people box for fitness, they often use a punching bag, avoiding the physical contact that can lead to concussions and other injuries.</p>
